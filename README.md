---How to Run---
This game can be run by opening it's .xcodeproj file and running it in the simulator. If you are having issues running it in the simulator (e.g. art assets missing), then try resetting the contents and settings of your simulator (Run the simulator --> Simulator --> Reset Content and Settings).



---Introduction---
Welcome to Claws of War!

Claws of War is roughly based off of the iPhone game Neko Atsume. In our app, the user begins the game in a small patch of mountainous terrain, exactly the size of the iPhone 5 screen (is still compatible with other screens). The user begins with only two items in the inventory: a small flat rock and a blackberry bush. This is enough to attract a couple of other local wildcats who will hang out in your yard. When they leave, they will leave the game’s main currency, “Prey Points”. Each cat has its own loyalty counter which increases each time it visits your yard. The higher the loyalty counter, the higher the chance of receiving more prey points from a single visit. With these prey points, you can buy new decorative items and food that you can place in your yard to attract more cats. The more prey points you have, the more items you can have and the more fun you will have.



---Game Mechanics---
In the beginning, your screen will open up to a empty yard, with two items in your inventory. Only when you have placed items in your yard there is a possiblity of cats appearing. Keep in mind that despite putting out items cats randomly come and go. Thus, it may take multiple launches of the game to have your first cat appear. This is long term game: it's not a bug, it's a feature!



---Future Plans---
We are excited about this game, so we plan to continue working on this game for some time after the end of this class. In the near future, we hope to implment food having an effect on cat loyalty so that having quality food placed in your territory increases cat loyalty, and have different poses for the cats depending on the items they are sitting and/or interacting with. In addition to this, while we have the logic set up for cats requring very specific items and/or food to have the possibility of appearing, we have been unable to implement them as of this time due to time limitations. 

In the far future, when a cat reaches a certain loyalty threshold it will officially join you in your territory. The more cats that you have the larger the territory you can hold at a time, thus allowing you to recruit more cats and gain more prey points. We intend to implement a world map allows all players of Claws of War to interact with each other: either by trading items and/or cats or by conquering territory held by other players to expand your own.



---Artwork---
The vast majority of our artwork was created by members of our team. However, some art assets were sourced from the internet. In the future, we hope to phase these externally sourced art assets from our game and replace them with in-house art.
